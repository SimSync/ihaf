# Insert into header and footer (IHAF)

Plugin for the e107 cms to insert text (custom javascript and/or css) into the page header and/or footer

This can be used to add the tracking codes for analysis software like Google Analytics, Matomo and others to the website.
With this plugin, you can define if the code should be only added to the page in the admin- or user area of the website or in both.

Any pull requests are welcome.
